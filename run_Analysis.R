## run_Analysis.R
# This is the R script for loading and tidying data for course project 1 of the Getting and Cleaning Data MOOC
# The script contains comments for the statements used. A more general explanation of the approach is available in the Readme markdown
# file available in the github repo. 
# There you can also find the code book for the variables selected.

# Load train measurements
# Specifications state that the script should work as long as the Samsung data is in the working directory. I have assumed this means
# the data should be in the working directory in the original folder structure, i.e. the directory UCI HAR Dataset should be in the 
# working directory. 
train_set <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", fill=TRUE, header=FALSE)
